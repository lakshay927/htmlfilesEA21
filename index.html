            is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            <i>Lorem Ipsum has been </i>the
            <mark>industry's standard</mark> dummy text ever since the 1500s,
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
            make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
            but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
            unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
            Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
            with desktop publishing software like
            <small> PageMaker including </small>versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            <strong>Why do we use it? </strong>It is a long established fact
            that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
            when looking at its layout.
            <em>The point of using Lorem Ipsum </em>is that it has a
            more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
            'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
            Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem
            Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'
            will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.

            Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
            sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Where does it
            come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply
            random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
            from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
            Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one
            of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
            passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
            literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
            from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
            (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This
            book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
            Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
            amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
